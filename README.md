# Web-Automation 
# What is a playwright?

Playwright is an open-source automation framework for testing web applications and performing browser automation. Developed by Microsoft, Playwright provides a high-level API that allows developers and testers to automate interactions with web browsers, such as Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
# Why Playwright is used?

Playwright provides a number of strong justifications for online automation:

Playwright supports a number of different web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit. As a result, you can run your tests on many browsers without changing the source.

Playwright offers a strong and reliable cross-browser API for automating web interactions across many browsers. Simulating user actions, interacting with DOM elements, and carrying out browser-specific activities are all simple to do.

Playwright offers two different test execution modes: headless for quicker performance and headful for debugging and troubleshooting. You have the freedom to select the ideal mode based on your requirements.

Playwright's built-in wait and retry mechanism makes sure that your tests wait for components to appear or situations to change.
